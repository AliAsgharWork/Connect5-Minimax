# Connect5 Minimax
---
This project is a attempt to improve the AI Functionality of the project I did in my first year of Coumputer Science BSc at Brunel University called 	[NC1601B-Year1-Lab7](https://github.com/AliAsgharWork/Connect5-NC1601B-Year1-Lab7)

During my year 1 project, I thought of using Mini-Max Algorithm to enable the AI to play aganist a Human player but due to a shortage if time i was not able to fully implement it. Now that i do have more time i am going to try to add the Algorithm and improve the architecture of the game
